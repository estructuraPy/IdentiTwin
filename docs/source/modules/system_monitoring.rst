Overview
--------

The ``system_monitoring`` module (placeholder) is intended to provide tools for monitoring system resources and overall performance. Currently, specific functionalities like detailed CPU, memory, disk, or network monitoring are primarily handled by the ``performance_monitor`` module, which focuses on acquisition timing and basic resource usage (CPU/Memory via psutil if available).

Key Features (Conceptual / Covered by other modules)
-----------

* Resource Monitoring (Partially covered by `performance_monitor`)
    - Real-time CPU utilization tracking
    - Memory usage statistics

* Performance Analysis (Partially covered by `performance_monitor`)
    - Data acquisition performance metrics (sampling rate, jitter)

* Alert System (Partially covered by `event_monitoring`)
    - Event detection based on sensor thresholds
